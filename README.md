## How It Works

- The game starts with the ball moving from the center.
- If the ball hits the top or bottom wall, it bounces off.
- If it hits a paddle, it bounces back and speeds up slightly.
- If it passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point and the ball resets.
- The game runs at 60 FPS and maintains consistent timing using Pygame's clock.
